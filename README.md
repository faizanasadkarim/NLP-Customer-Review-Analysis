# Customer Sentiment and Behavior Analysis for E-Commerce with Streamlit Dashboard

## Objective
This project aims to empower a womenâ€™s clothing e-commerce platform by analyzing customer reviews to improve overall satisfaction. By analyzing sentiment and identifying key themes from customer feedback, we can provide actionable insights that help enhance the customer experience.

## Overview
The primary goal is to analyze customer reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning models** to identify factors that influence customer sentiment and behavior. The project involves:

- Conducting sentiment analysis on reviews to gauge customer satisfaction.
- Using predictive modeling to determine the key drivers of sentiment.
- Extracting key themes and topics from reviews using topic modeling techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Processing toolkit for text analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning for predictive modeling and classification.
- **Gensim**: Topic modeling to extract key themes from reviews.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization for insights.

## Techniques Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the dataset to understand trends, patterns, and outliers.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to analyze the sentiment of reviews.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Technique to assess the importance of words in the customer reviews.
- **Random Forest**: Machine learning model to predict factors driving customer sentiment and behavior.

## How to Run
Follow these steps to run the analysis on your own machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/faizanasadkarim/NLP-Customer-Review-Analysis

## Results & Insights
The following outputs are produced by the analysis:

Sentiment Distribution: Visual representation of customer satisfaction levels using bar charts and histograms.
Key Sentiment Drivers: Identification of features (such as product quality, shipping, or customer service) that most impact customer sentiment.
Themes and Topics: Major themes extracted from the reviews using topic modeling (LDA) that influence customer opinions.
## Insights:
Positive Sentiment: Customers tend to leave positive reviews related to product fit and quality.
Negative Sentiment: Complaints frequently focus on delivery times or customer service issues.
Common Themes: Topics such as "material quality", "size fitting", and "delivery speed" often emerge as common themes.
