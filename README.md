NLP-woman-clothing
Overview
This project is focused on analyzing customer behavior in a leading women’s clothing e-commerce platform. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project aims to extract meaningful insights from customer reviews, ratings, and demographics to help the business make data-driven decisions. The key goals are to explore data patterns, perform sentiment analysis, and predict customer preferences to enhance business strategies.

Business Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform a thorough analysis of customer data to understand key patterns.
Text Mining & Sentiment Analysis:
Perform text mining to identify the most frequent terms associated with positive and negative sentiment.
Generate word clouds for both positive and negative reviews.
Customer Sentiment Analysis:
Analyze customer sentiment based on different factors such as product categories, location, and age group.
Predictive Analytics:
Build models to predict which customers are likely to recommend products and predict ratings based on review text.
Topic Mining:
Use topic modeling techniques (e.g., LDA) to extract common themes from reviews.
Expected Outputs
The outputs expected from this project include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations and insights into review ratings, demographics, and behavior patterns.
Dashboards that showcase sentiment analysis by channel, location, category, subcategories, age group, etc.
Predictive Models:
Classification models that predict whether a customer will recommend a product.
Regression models for predicting ratings based on customer reviews.
Text Mining & Sentiment Analysis:
Word clouds for positive and negative reviews.
Frequency plots of common words in reviews segmented by sentiment and product features.
Topic Modeling:
A set of identified topics and their corresponding themes based on customer feedback.
Data
The dataset consists of over 23,000 customer reviews, ratings, and associated metadata. The data is structured in the following 11 columns:

Column Name	Description
Product ID	Unique identifier for the clothing item.
Category	Product category (e.g., Dresses, Tops, etc.).
Subcategory1	First level subcategory (e.g., Casual, Formal).
Subcategory2	Second level subcategory (e.g., Summer, Winter).
Location	Customer’s geographic location (e.g., City, Country).
Customer Age	Age of the customer.
Channel	Channel used for the review (e.g., Web, Mobile).
Review Title	Title of the customer review.
Review Text	Full text of the customer review.
Rating	Rating given by the customer (1 to 5).
Recommend Flag	Whether the customer recommends the product (Yes/No).
Workflow
The workflow for this project involves the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the text data (removing stopwords, lemmatization, etc.).
Handle missing data, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of ratings, review lengths, and customer demographics.
Explore the relationship between product categories, age, location, and customer sentiments.
Sentiment Analysis:
Classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using sentiment analysis techniques (e.g., VADER, TextBlob).
Create word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in positive vs. negative reviews.
Predictive Analytics:
Build machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict whether a customer will recommend a product.
Build regression models (e.g., Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting) to predict ratings based on review text.
Topic Modeling:
Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or other topic modeling techniques to identify common themes across reviews.
Dashboarding:
Visualize key insights and metrics using data visualization tools like Tableau or PowerBI.
Create an interactive dashboard to display sentiments, review distributions, and predictive model outcomes.
